			<h3>About Me</h3>

			<p>

			Master's Degree in Innovation Economics and Management at Faculty of Economics of Porto, Portugal.

			I consider having some lifetime achievements, however one that will always follow me is when I completed my MSc in one the prestigious faculty's of economics in Portugal and at the same time integrating - out of thousands of applicants - the opportunity to embark on an international professional experience funded by the Portuguese Government Trade & Investment Agency - AICEP InovContacto. These two achievements granted me the opportunity to enter the world of startups and develop as a professional at a quick pace. 

			My major passions include travelling, cooking, wild life and nature. In few words, Im an enthusiast of the great things that life has to offer. Whenever I have the chance I like to travel, meet different people and interact with different cultures - a passion that has been with with me since little. Also, I am strongly interested in supporting causes such as wild life, environmental and ecological awareness.</p>
